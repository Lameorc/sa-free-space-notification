# sa-free-space-notification
Since the student agency buses are often full, it's nice to have a notification when a free space apears. Historically I've used sanotify but as that app is no longer working, I've started work on this alternative.

It's currently pretty bad and slow but serves my purpose. In future, I'd like to extend the app into full gui app.
